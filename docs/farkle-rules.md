# Farkle Rules

Farkle (also known as "Farkel" or "Hot Dice") is a fun dice game that requires both luck and strategy. Here are the complete rules in a simple, easy-to-understand format:

## Equipment
- Six standard dice
- 1 or more players

## Objective
Be the first player to score 10,000 points.

## Basic Play
1.  On your turn, roll all six dice.
2.  After each roll, you must set aside at least one scoring die.
3.  You may choose to roll again with remaining dice, or bank your points.
4.  If you can't set aside any scoring dice after a roll, you "Farkle" and lose all points accumulated during that turn.

## Scoring
-   **Single 1:** 100 points
-   **Single 5:** 50 points
-   **Three of a kind:** Value of die Ã— 100 (except three 1's = 1,000 points)
    -   Three 1's = 1,000 points
    -   Three 2's = 200 points
    -   Three 3's = 300 points
    -   Three 4's = 400 points
    -   Three 5's = 500 points
    -   Three 6's = 600 points
-   **Four of a kind:** 1,000 points
-   **Five of a kind:** 2,000 points
-   **Six of a kind:** 3,000 points
-   **Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6):** 1,500 points
-   **Three pairs:** 1,500 points (e.g., 2-2, 4-4, 5-5)
-   **Two triplets:** 2,500 points (e.g., 2-2-2, 4-4-4)

## Important Rules
-   You must set aside at least one scoring die after each roll.
-   You can only score dice on the roll where they appear (no combining across rolls).
-   If all six dice score in a single roll (this is sometimes called "hot dice"), you can roll all six again and continue your turn, adding to your current turn's score.
-   **Getting on the Board:** Most versions require a minimum score (e.g., 500 points) in a single turn to get "on the board" for the first time. Once a player is on the board, they can bank any score.
-   **Ending the Game:** The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 10,000 points. After a player reaches this target and banks their points, all other players get one final turn to try to beat that high score. The player with the highest score after these final turns wins.

## Example Turn
1.  You roll six dice and get: **1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6**
2.  You set aside the **1** (100 points) and **5** (50 points). Current turn score: 150 points.
3.  You roll the remaining four dice and get: **1, 3, 3, 4**
4.  You set aside the **1** (100 more points). Current turn score: 250 points.
5.  You roll the remaining three dice and get: **2, 2, 2**
6.  You set aside the three **2's** (200 points). Current turn score: 450 points.
7.  You decide to bank your 450 points rather than risk rolling the remaining zero dice (or rolling all six again if "hot dice" rules apply to only three dice being scored, which varies by house rule - typically hot dice applies if all six dice are scored).

## Strategy Tips
-   Early in the game, take more risks to establish a lead or get on the board.
-   Later in the game, be more conservative when you have a good score to protect, especially if you are in the lead.
-   If another player is close to winning, you may need to take bigger risks to catch up.
